# OS161

OS161 is my project for CS350: Operating System. <br>
Through the course, we added multiple features to OS161 so that it's working properly (e.g. synchronization, memory allocation, etc).

Here is a list of implemented features:
- locks (implemented using spinlocks and conditional variables)
- system calls (fork, getpid, waitpid, exit and _execv)
- virtual memory system (malloc, free, TLB management, page table)
